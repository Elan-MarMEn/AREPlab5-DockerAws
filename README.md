## Getting Started

Open your comand console or cmd and write or copy the comand below.

```
git clone 
```

### Prerequisites

Make sure that you already have install Maven,java kit Development and GIT correctly. in he case that you don`t konow how to install use the links below:

## Compile and Running
Get in to your cmd and use the commands below

```
mvn clean install

mvn package
```

For get the javadoc use:

```
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

Once you run the project you can use the URIÂ´s below to access to all allowed(Existing) requests:

For static files:
```
.../Arep/index.html

.../Arep/styles.css

.../Arep/app.js
```

For lambda functions:
```
.../Apps/customers
```
the rest of the request will be access to a default response. 

## Docker Local Running

For see a local running you must to use the command below
to create a image for the Dockerfile

```
docker build -t {NameOfImage} .
```
then use the same command to generate a second image or you can modify the file docker-compose.yml 
to resume this process and build the images and containers in just one comand like this:

* with images:

* to build images:

after this configuration for running the image in a container run:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Now you can put in the URI " http://localhost:34005/ " and you will see this:

## AWS Running

In this case the local image must be load in DockerHub and then you will pull them on 
the virtual machine (Note: you should install docker and docker-compose on the AWS machine), then with 
images you just have to create a new directory for create and store your docker-compose.yml. 
Now you have tools just left to run the docker compose command:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
After this you can see on AWS web direction:


Remember to enable the ports that you need to use for running the Aplication:



## Local Running

If you want to run the appweb on a local port, you migth install herokuCli and then use the comand below.

```
heroku local web
```
or for windows:
```
java  -cp target/classes;target/dependency/* edu.escuelaing.arep.heroku.app.SparkWebApp
```
for Unix:
```
java $JAVA_OPTS -cp target/classes:target/dependency/* edu.escuelaing.arep.heroku.app.SparkWebApp
```

Use the next comand to know the result of the tests

```
mvn test
```
